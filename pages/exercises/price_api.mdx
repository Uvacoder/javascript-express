# Price API

Using the coindesk API, https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/historical/close.json, for the last 30 days of BTC prices:

1. Define a new `BitcointPriceIndex` type that describes the data returned by the API

2. Fetch the API data and parse the result. We want the data to have the type `BitcointPriceIndex` after this point.

3. Find the highest price in the last month, and print the date it occurred using the `moment` format `MMMM Do` (e.g. `"June 3rd"`). (If the price happened twice, use the first date it occurred)

> This exercise covers materials from the sections: types, syntax, collections, functions.

<Example
  height={850}
  code={priceApiStarter}
  vendorComponents={[moment]}

# Promises

Promises are an abstraction for asynchronous control flow â€” they're a proxy object for a value that may not exist yet. A `Promise` is always in 1 of 3 states internally:

- Pending
- Resolved
- Rejected

A resolved or rejected promise optionally contains a value. 

Every promise starts in the pending state, and can only transition once (i.e. a resolved promise never becomes rejected later).

> Promises are similar to futures and deferred values in other languages (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises).

## Creating promises

We can immediately wrap any value in a promise using the static `Promise.resolved` and `Promise.rejected` methods.

More commonly, we use the constructor, which we can `resolve` or `reject` at any point in the future.

<Example
  title={"Creating promises"}
  code={creatingPromises}
/>

## Chaining promises

We can use `.then` and `.catch` to chain operations together. These methods both return _new_ promises.

If we throw an error or return a rejected promise, all `.then` calls will be skipped until a `.catch` is found.

> By convention, a rejected promise should contain an error object rather than an arbitrary value. Throwing an error implicitly creates a rejected promise.

<Example
  title={"Chaining promises"}
  code={chainingPromises}
/>

## Handling events

So far, we've been using promises synchronously, but we typically use them asynchronously while working with the event loop. 

For example, we might wrap a `setTimeout` call in a promise.

> Anywhere we use a callback that will _only be called once_ we should consider using a `Promise` instead.

<Example
  title={"Handling events"}
  code={sleep}
/>

## Multiple promises

We can use promises to run multiple asynchronous tasks in parallel.

`Promise.all` returns a promise that resolves if all promises in an array resolve, while `Promise.race` resolves if a single promise in the array to resolve.

<Example
  title={"Multiple promises"}
  code={multiplePromises}

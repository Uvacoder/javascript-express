# Fetch

We use the `fetch` function to make a network request. Since `fetch` returns a `Promise`, we can use the `async` and `await` syntax to simplify our code.

> Fetch is available in the browser and React Native as a global variable. In `node`, we typically install https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch.

Sometimes the same object will **emit** multiple types of events with different names. For example, a button might emit both a `"press"` and `"longpress"` event.

Objects that emit multiple events are often implemented using an **event emitter** class (either built-in or from a library).

We typically call event handler functions **event listeners** when they handle (or listen for) named events.

## Listeners

Listeners are common when handling user input. 

In the browser, for example, buttons emit a `"click"` event, and we can use `addEventListener` to handle it.

<Example
  title={"Event listeners"}
  code={eventListeners}
  sharedEnvironment={true}
/>

## Emitters

Some environments like `node.js` and React Native come with a built-in event emitter class.

Here's how a custom one might be implemented.

> Event emitters don't fundamentally have to interact with the event loop â€” handlers can be called synchronously too. However, using the event emitter pattern doesn't make as much sense in this case.

<Example
  title={"Event emitters"}
  code={eventEmitter}
/>

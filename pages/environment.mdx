# Environment

JavaScript most often runs in the web browser or using the command line application, `node.js`.

In this guide, we'll be using an embedded web-based sandbox for our examples. However, if you'd prefer to set up an environment on your computer and use your favorite text editor or IDE, here are a couple options.

> There's no need to set up a local environment for this guide, so feel free to skip to the next section, [Types](/types).

## HTML file

The simplest way to get started with a local environment is by creating an HTML file on your computer. Create a file `example.html` somewhere on your computer, open it in your favorite code editor, and paste in the following code:

<Example panes={['editor']} title={'example.html'} showTitle code={`<script>\n  console.log('Hello, world!')\n</script>`} />

Save the file and open it in your web browser (probably by double clicking it). You should see a completely blank webpage.

Next, open the JavaScript console. This is a built-in feature of web browsers, although it works a little differently in each browser. Here's a brief set of instructions for some common browsers:

- **Chrome** - Go to `View > Developer > JavaScript Console`
- **Firefox** - Go to `Tools > Web Developer > Web Console`
- **Safari** - In `Preferences`, under the `Advanced` tab, enable the checkbox `Show Develop menu`. Then, `Develop > Show JavaScript Console`

These instructions are different depending on your operating system and browser version, but if you have trouble finding it, a quick Google search for "open JavaScript console [browser name]" should bring up instructions.

After opening it, you should see something like this (Safari) screenshot:

The results of our `console.log` function call are printed at the bottom of the screen. If we change the file, we can refresh the browser to run our updated code.

## Node.js

`node.js` is a command line application for running JavaScript on your computer. You can download and install the application from [the node website](https://nodejs.org).

Once downloaded, in the terminal, you can run JavaScript files with `node [filename]`.

So for example, create a file `example.js` and paste in the following code:

<Example panes={['editor']} title={'example.js'} showTitle code={`console.log('Hello, world!')`} />

Save the file, and then in the terminal navigate to the same directory as the `example.js` file, and run `node example.js`.

You should see `Hello, world!` print to the terminal.

### Up next

For the rest of this guide, any example code we use should work in both your web browser and `node.js`. With that, let's get started!

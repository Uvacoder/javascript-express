import functionType from '../examples/files/types/functionType.ts'

In this section, we'll cover the semantics of declaring functions.

As we saw in the [Object Types](/types/object_types) section, there are two syntaxes for declaring functions:

- The `function` keyword
- Arrow (`=>`) function expressions

These syntaxes have somewhat different behavior, which we'll cover soon.

<Example
  title={"Functions"}
  code={functionType}
/>

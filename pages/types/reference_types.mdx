# Reference Types

Everything that isn't a primitive type is a reference type. 

The main differences are: 

- Primitive types are **immutable**, while reference types are **mutable** 
- Primitive types are passed to functions **by value** (a copy of the data), while reference types are passed **by reference** (the original).

There are 3 extremely common built-in reference types: `Array`, `Object`, and `Function`.

## Arrays

We use array literal syntax to declare arrays:

<Example   
  title={"Arrays"}
  code={arrayType}
/>

---

## Objects

Objects are associative arrays (a.k.a maps or dictionaries). We use object literal syntax to declare objects.

> Objects are used extensively throughout JavaScript, both in the standard library and implementation of OOP (classes, inheritance, etc).

<Example
  title={"Objects"}
  code={objectType}
/>

## Functions

Functions are reference types. They can assigned to variables and passed as arguments to other functions.

There are two ways to declare functions:

- The `function` keyword
- Arrow (`=>`) function expressions

<Example
  title={"Functions"}
  code={functionType}

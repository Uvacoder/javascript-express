# Library Types

There are _many_ other types in the standard library. Let's take a look at a few common ones:

- `Date`
- `RegExp`

> JavaScript runtime environments include additional types beyond those defined by the core JavaScript language. E.g. Chrome, Node, and React Native all include their own additional types beyond what the standard library provides.

## Dates

We can use the `Date` class for interacting with dates.

<Example   
  title={"Dates"}
  code={dateType}
/>

---

## Regular Expressions

We can use the `RegExp` class for interacting with regular expressions.

<Example   
  title={"Regular Expressions"}
  code={regExpType}
/>

Sometimes we want to check the type of a value _at runtime_. 

For primitive types and functions, we do this by accessing the _name_ of the type using the `typeof` keyword.

For object types, there isn't a single best approach, but we'll look at a couple.

---

## Primitive type names

We can find the type name of a primitive or function value using the `typeof` operator:

<Example   
  title={"Primitive type names"}
  code={typeofExample}
/>

---

## Checking object types

We typically use the `instanceof` operator to compare an object value with its constructor.

However, there are some edge cases where we may rely on special library methods like `Array.isArray` instead. 

<Example   
  title={"Checking object types"}
  code={instanceofExample}
/>

---

## Object type names

Generally we should use `instanceof`, but we _can_ find the type name of an object value if we really want to.

> Note that this runs much more slowly than `typeof` or `instanceof`.

<Example   
  title={"Object type names"}
  code={className}
/>

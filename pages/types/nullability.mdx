# Nullability

JavaScript has two different values used to represent "nothing": `null` and `undefined`.

---

## Undefined

The value `undefined` roughly means "this value doesn't exist". Here are a few common places where you'll see it: 

- It's the value of a variable before it gets assigned a value
- It's the return value of a function without a return statement
- It's the value when accessing an object with an unknown key

<Example   
  title={"Undefined"}
  code={undefinedType}
/>

---

## Null

The value `null` is used for _object_ non-existence. It roughly means, "there is no object here".

Conceptually, it's similar to the empty string for strings, or 0 for numbers.

> In practice, `undefined` is often used for this same purpose.

<Example   
  title={"Null"}
  code={nullType}
/>

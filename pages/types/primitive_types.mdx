# Primitive types

There are 7 primitive types:

- `undefined`
- `null`
- `Boolean`
- `Number`
- `String`
- `BigInt`
- `Symbol`

Primitive types are **immutable**.

> We'll look at `undefined` and `null` when we cover nullability. `BigInt` and `Symbol` are less common.

## Primitive values

We declare primitive types using... primitive values (i.e. literals).

<Example   
  title={"Literal values"}
  code={literals}
/>

---

## Constructor functions

It's also possible to instantiate the built-in types using their constructors â€” however, this is relatively uncommon and not idiomatic for common usage.

<Example 
  title={'Constructor functions'}
  code={primitiveConstructors}
/>

---

## Standard library methods

We use standard library methods for manipulating primitives. These are available as methods on each instance.

> JavaScript uses _autoboxing_ to make these methods available even on literal values.

<Example 
  title={'Standard library methods'}
  code={primitiveMethods}
/>

## Type casting

There are library methods for casting strings to numbers and vice versa:

<Example 
  title={'Type casting'}
  code={primitiveCasting}

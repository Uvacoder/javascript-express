# Object Types

Everything that isn't a primitive type is an object type. 

Object types are **mutable** and passed to functions **by reference** (i.e. modifying the value within a function modifies original).

There are 3 extremely common built-in object types: `Object`, `Array`, and `Function`.

---

## Objects

The class `Object` is the base class of all object types. Objects are associative arrays (a.k.a maps or dictionaries).

Keys can only be strings (or symbols), although we can restrict the set of allowed keys (e.g. to numbers) using type annotations â€” non-string keys will be coerced to strings at runtime.

> Objects are used extensively throughout JavaScript, both in the standard library and implementation of OOP (classes, inheritance, etc).

<Example
  title={"Objects"}
  code={objectType}
/>

---

## Arrays

The `Array` class is a subclass of `Object` that handles integer keys specially.

We use array literal syntax to declare arrays:

<Example   
  title={"Arrays"}
  code={arrayType}
/>

---

## Functions

Functions are objects that can be called. They can assigned to variables and passed as arguments to other functions, just like any other value.

There are two ways to declare functions:

- The `function` keyword
- Arrow (`=>`) function expressions

<Example
  title={"Functions"}
  code={functionType}
/>

---

## Using objects

Since all object types are subclasses of `Object`, even `Array` and `Function` values are associative arrays. This means we can assign arbitrary keys and values.

However, we _generally_ shouldn't use them like this it's not their intended purpose.

> There are some standard library methods and 3rd party frameworks that do this, so it's more a suggestion than a rule.

<Example
  title={"Intended purposes"}
  code={intendedPurpose}
/>

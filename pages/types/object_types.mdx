# Object Types

Everything that isn't a primitive type is an object type. 

Object types are **mutable** and passed to functions **by reference** (i.e. modifying the value within a function modifies original).

There are 3 extremely common built-in object types: `Object`, `Array`, and `Function`.

## Objects

The `Object` type is the base class of all other object types.

Objects are associative arrays (a.k.a maps or dictionaries). We use object literal syntax to declare objects.

> Objects are used extensively throughout JavaScript, both in the standard library and implementation of OOP (classes, inheritance, etc).

<Example
  title={"Objects"}
  code={objectType}
/>

---

## Arrays

We use array literal syntax to declare arrays:

<Example   
  title={"Arrays"}
  code={arrayType}
/>

---

## Functions

Functions are object types. They can assigned to variables and passed as arguments to other functions.

There are two ways to declare functions:

- The `function` keyword
- Arrow (`=>`) function expressions

<Example
  title={"Functions"}
  code={functionType}
/>

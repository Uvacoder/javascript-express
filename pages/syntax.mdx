# Syntax

JavaScript has most of the features you'd expect from a general purpose high-level programming language:

- Variables & constants
- Comparison, logical, math, and bitwise operators
- For loops, while loops, break, continue
- If statements, switch statements
- Functions & lambdas
- Type annotations (when using TypeScript)
- Error handling

> The syntax is generally similar to the C family of languages, so if you're not sure what to do, add parentheses around expressions and curly braces around blocks!

# Any and Unknown

The types `any` and `unknown` are used when we don't know the type of a value (e.g. dynamic content like parsed json).

## Any

The type `any` essentially disables type-checking for a value. A variable with type `any` can be assigned any value, passed to any function, and called with any arguments, etc.

<Example   
  title={"Any"}
  code={any}
/>

## Unknown

The type `unknown` is the type-safe version of `any`. A variable with type `unknown` can't be used for anything without first refining it to another type.

Many standard library functions use `any`, but we should generally use `unknown` instead. Unknown is relatively new - otherwise more standard library functions would probably use it.

<Example   
  title={"Unknown"}
  code={unknown}
/>

## Checking unknown keys

Due to [current limitations](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/21732) of the `in` operator, it's difficult to check if a key exists on an `unknown` value.

This is one case where `any` may make more sense for convenience. However, you can define a type guard function to accomplish this.

> We'll cover type guards in more detail right after this

<Example   
  title={"Checking unknown keys"}
  code={hasProperty}
/>

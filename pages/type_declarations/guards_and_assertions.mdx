We often refine more general types into more specific types (i.e. downcasting). There are 2 approaches for this in TypeScript: type assertions and type guards.

> TypeScript generally infers _upcasts_ automatically.

## Type assertions

We use type assertions to explicitly change the compile-time type of a value. We do this when we _know something the compiler doesn't_.

The types `any` and `unknown` can be asserted as any type. Other types can be asserted too, but TypeScript will prevent the assertion if the types are incompatible (e.g. `4 as string`).

<Example   
  title={"Type assertions"}
  code={assertions}
/>

## Type guards

We use type guards to refine the compile-time type of a value by reasoning about its runtime value. We can use built-in expressions like `typeof`, standard library functions like `Array.isArray`, or even write our own.

<Example   
  title={"Type guards"}
  code={guards}
/>

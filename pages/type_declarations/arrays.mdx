# Arrays

Arrays are a generic type that takes 1 type argument: the type of the element.

<Example   
  title={"Arrays"}
  code={arrays}
/>

## Tuples

JavaScript doesn't have a tuple type. Instead, we often use mixed-type arrays with a specific number of elements. TypeScript has a special tuple syntax to describe these kinds of arrays.

<Example   
  title={"Tuples"}
  code={tuples}
/>

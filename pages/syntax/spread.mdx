import spread from '../../examples/files/syntax/spread.ts'

The spread syntax `...` is a convenient way to merge or copy Objects and Arrays.

> Not to be confused with [rest parameter syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters), which is also `...`.

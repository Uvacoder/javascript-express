# Logical Operators

The main logical operators are:

- `&&` - and
- `||` - or
- `!` - not

These automatically coerce types, which _is_ idiomatic to do, despite being somewhat confusing.

---

## Truthiness

When using logical operators, the operands will be coerced to booleans before being compared. 

Values coerced to `true` are called **truthy** values; all other values are **falsy** values. The falsy values:

| Type | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Boolean | `false` |
| Number and BigInt | `0`, `-0`, `0n`, `-0n`, `NaN` |
| String | `""` |
| Other | `null`, `undefined` |

> A **truthy** value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context. All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy. (Definition: [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy)).

---

## Not Operator

We use `!` to convert a **truthy** value to `false`, or a **falsy** value to `true`.

<Example   
  title={"Not Operator"}
  code={notOperator}

## And Operator

The `&&` operator takes two operands: 

- If the first operand is falsy, it **evaluates to the first operand** 
- If the first operand is truthy, and it **evaluates to the second operand**

<Example   
  title={"And Operator"}
  code={andOperator}
/>

---

## Or Operator

The `||` operator takes two operands: 

- If the first operand is truthy, it **evaluates to the first operand** 
- If the first operand is false, and it **evaluates to the second operand**

<Example   
  title={"Or Operator"}
  code={orOperator}
/>

---

## Short Circuiting

Both `&&` and `||` are _short-circuiting_ operators:

- `&&`: if the first operand is evaluated as falsy, the second operand will not be evaluated at all (i.e. side-effects will not occur)
- `||`: if the first operand is evaluated as truthy, the second operand will not be evaluated at all

<Example   
  title={"Short Circuiting"}
  code={shortCircuiting}

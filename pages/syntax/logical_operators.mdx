# Logical Operators

The main logical operators are:

- `&&` - and
- `||` - or
- `!` - not

These automatically coerce types, which _is_ idiomatic to do, despite being somewhat confusing.

---

## Truthiness

When using logical operators, the operands will be coerced to booleans before being compared. We refer to values that are coerced to `true` as **truthy** values, and values that are coerced to `false` as **falsy** values.

> A **truthy** value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context. All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy. (Definition: [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy)).

There are 8 falsy values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `false` | The keyword `false` |
| `0` | The number zero |
| `-0` | The number negative zero |
| `0n` | BigInt, when used as a boolean, follows the same rule as a Number. 0n is falsy. |
| `""` | Empty string value |
| `null` | `null` - the absence of any value |
| `undefined` | `undefined` - the primitive value |
| `NaN` | `NaN` - not a number |

## Not Operator

We use `!` to convert a **truthy** value to `false`, or a **falsy** value to `true`.

## And Operator

The `&&` operator takes two operands: 

- If the first operand is falsy, it **evaluates to the first operand** 
- If the first operand is truthy, and it **evaluates to the second operand**

## Or Operator

The `&&` operator takes two operands: 

- If the first operand is truthy, it **evaluates to the first operand** 
- If the first operand is false, and it **evaluates to the second operand**

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Or Operator"}
  code={orOperator}
/>

## Short Circuiting

Both `&&` and `||` are _short-circuiting_ operators:

- `&&`: if the first operand is evaluated as falsy, the second operand will not be evaluated at all (i.e. side-effects will not occur)
- `||`: if the first operand is evaluated as truthy, the second operand will not be evaluated at all

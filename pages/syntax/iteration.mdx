# Iteration

There are several approaches to iteration:

- `for`, `while`, and `do while` loops
- `for ... in` and `for ... of` loops for object iteration
- `forEach` for array iteration (and `map`, `reduce`, etc. for array transformation)

> Generally, `forEach` and array transformations are slightly more idiomatic than loops, since they express the developer's intent more clearly. However, loops perform faster.

---

## Loops

JavaScript supports `for`, `while`, and `do while` loops. We can use `break` to exit the loop immediately or `continue` to advance to the next iteration. Nested loops can be labeled.

> These have essentially the same syntax and work the same way as in other C-like languages.

<Example   
  title={"Loops"}
  code={loops}
/>

---

## For ... of

We can use a `for ... of` loop to iterate through _values_ within an object.

We do this most commonly with arrays, but many standard library objects can be iterated this way. 

> We can also define custom iteration behavior.

<Example   
  title={"For of"}
  code={forOf}
/>

---

## For ... in

The `for ... in` loop iterates through the _keys_ of an object.

However, it also includes inherited properties, which is often not what we want.

> Due to historical complexities, `for ... in` loops aren't very common.

<Example   
  title={"For in"}
  code={forIn}
/>

---

## hasOwnProperty

If we do want to use a `for ... in` loop, we can use the `hasOwnProperty` method to filter inherited properties.

> Modifying the prototype of a class will modify key lookup behavior for _every_ object, and is something you should almost never do. However, it's possible that a library may do it (possibly by mistake), so it's still something to watch out for.

<Example   
  title={"hasOwnProperty"}
  code={hasOwnProperty}
/>

---

## forEach

We use `forEach` to call a function for each element of an array. The function is also passed the element, the element's index, and the array itself.

We'll generally use this instead of `for ... of`, unless we need to exit the loop early (i.e. `break` doesn't exist in `forEach` loops).

<Example   
  title={"forEach"}
  code={forEach}
/>

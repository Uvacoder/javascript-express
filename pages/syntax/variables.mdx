import variables from '../../examples/files/syntax/variables.ts'
import constants from '../../examples/files/syntax/constants.ts'

Declare variables with `let` and constants with `const`. 

> Avoid variable declarations with `var` unless maintaining legacy code

## Constants with mutable values

With `const`, a _name_ is permanently bound to a value in scope and can't be reassigned.

However, if the _value_ is an object, then the value is still mutable.

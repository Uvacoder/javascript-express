# Variables

Declare variables with `let` and constants with `const`. 

> Somebody on your team will have a string opinion about when to use one or the other.

## Declaring variables and constants

Here's an example of both in action:

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Declaring variables and constants"}
  code={variables}
/>

---

## Constants with mutable values

With `const`, a _name_ is permanently bound to a value in scope. 

However, if the _value_ is a reference value, then the value is still mutable.

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Constants with mutable values"}
  code={constants}
/>

JavaScript environments include a huge set of built-in constants, functions, and classes to help us write applications. We don't have to import any library files to access these built-ins â€” they're _all_ available as global variables. 

While these aren't normally called a standard library (since we don't import anything), they're roughly analogous to a standard library in other languages.

> These built-ins are defined by the language specification: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/

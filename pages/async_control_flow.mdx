JavaScript engines are built around a single main [event loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop), which is a queue of functions. When a program starts, the engine evaluates all JavaScript code at the top-level scope and then goes "idle" until new "events" (functions) are added to the event loop.

New events may be inserted into the event loop at any time, either by our code or the JavaScript environment (usually in response to I/O), which are then executed in sequence.

We use callback functions and Promises to work with the event loop.

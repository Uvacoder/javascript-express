# Modules

A **module** or **package** typically refers to a collection of JavaScript files.

We use either the `npm` or `yarn` package managers to automatically download and manage versions of modules. A JavaScript project will have a `node_modules` directory containing the downloaded files.

We typically download 3rd party library modules from the [**npm** package registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). 

> While `npm` is the _Node.js_ package manager, we use it for all kinds of JavaScript projects, even those that don't use Node.js. Some packages, however, will only work in specific environments, e.g. Node.js, the web, React Native.

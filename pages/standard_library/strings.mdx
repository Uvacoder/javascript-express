# Strings

Strings support index-based character access with square brackets `[]` and have a `.length` property just like arrays. We concatenate strings with `+`.

Common standard library methods include: 

- `split`
- `slice` (the same as `Array`!)
- `charCodeAt`
- `toUpperCase`
- `toLowerCase`

---

## Split

Split a string into an array using a `delimiter` argument.

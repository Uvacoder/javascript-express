# Maps

Maps are mutable collections of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, and uniqueness is determined by (roughly) `===` comparison.

Unlike objects, keys can be any value, not just strings and symbols.

The main APIs are:

- `set`
- `get`
- `has`
- `delete`

> It's still much more common to use objects than maps

## Working with maps

When working with maps, we commonly convert them to and from arrays, since arrays have more built-in methods for transforming the contents.

> This array of "tuples" is the same as what `Object.entries` returns for objects

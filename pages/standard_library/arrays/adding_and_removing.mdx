# Adding and Removing

There are a variety of standard library methods for modifying the contents of arrays. In this section, we'll look at:

- `push`
- `pop`
- `shift`
- `unshift`
- `splice`

---

## Adding and Removing Elements

To add or remove from the _end_ of an array, we use `push` and `pop`.

To add or remove from the _front_, we use `shift` and `unshift`.

<Example   
  title={"Adding and Removing"}
  code={arraysAddingAndRemoving}
/>

---

## Inserting and Deleting

We can use `splice` to insert or delete elements from any part of the array.

<Example   
  title={"Splice"}
  code={splice}
/>

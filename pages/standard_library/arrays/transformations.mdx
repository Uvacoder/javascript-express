Sometimes we want to transform an array into a new array or another kind of value. We can use:

- `slice`
- `concat`
- `filter`
- `map`
- `flat`
- `reduce`
- `join`

When we copy elements from the original array to a new array, we're only copying _references_. In other words, mutating an element in the copy will mutate it in the original array too. We often call this a "shallow" copy.

## Slices

We use `slice` to create a copy of part (or all) of an array. 

<Example   
  title={"Slice"}
  code={slice}
/>

---

## Concat

We use `concat` to join multiple arrays in a new array (as an alternative to the [spread syntax](/syntax/spread)).

Any parameters that are arrays are flattened into the new array. Any parameters that aren't arrays are added as elements directly.

> Spread is usually more concise than `concat`, and therefore more common in code.

<Example   
  title={"Concat"}
  code={concat}
/>

---

## Filter

We use `filter` to make a new array that contains a subset of the elements of the original.

<Example   
  title={"Filter"}
  code={filter}
/>

---

## Map

We use `map` to transform each element into a different element (potentially of a different type).

<Example   
  title={"Map"}
  code={map}
/>

---

## Flat

We use `flat` to flatten nested arrays into a single array. There's an optional `depth` argument to flatten recursively.

<Example   
  title={"Flat"}
  code={flat}
/>

---

## Reduce

We use `reduce` to combine each element in the array into a single value (of an arbitrary type).

<Example   
  title={"Reduce"}
  code={reduce}
/>

---

## Join

We use `join` to combine each element in the array into a single string, seperated by a `separator` string argument.

> Each element is first automatically converted to a string with `toString`

<Example   
  title={"Join"}
  code={join}
/>

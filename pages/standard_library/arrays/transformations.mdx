# Transformations

Sometimes we want to transform an array into a new array or another kind of value. We can use:

- `slice`
- `concat`
- `filter`
- `map`
- `flat`
- `reduce`
- `join`

When we copy elements from the original array to a new array, we're only copying _references_. In other words, mutating an element in the copy will mutate it in the original array too. We often call this a "shallow" copy.

## Slices

We use `slice` to create a copy of part (or all) of an array. 

<Example   
  title={"Slice"}
  code={slice}
/>

---

## Concat

We use `concat` to join multiple arrays in a new array (as an alternative to the [spread syntax](/syntax/spread)).

Any parameters that are arrays are flattened into the new array. Any parameters that aren't arrays are added as elements directly.

> Spread is usually more concise than `concat`, and therefore more common in code.

<Example   
  title={"Concat"}
  code={concat}
/>

---

## Filter

We use `filter` to make a new array that contains a subset of the elements of the original.

<Example   
  title={"Filter"}
  code={filter}
/>

## Map

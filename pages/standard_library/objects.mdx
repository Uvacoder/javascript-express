We use objects extremely frequently â€” probably more than any other data structure. In this section, we'll cover:

- Adding and removing keys
- Checking existence of keys
- Clone and merging
- Converting to and from arrays

Generally we'll only use these techniques with "plain objects", but these all technically work on class instances too.

## Adding and removing elements

We add new elements or update existing elements by assigning a value to a specific key. We remove elements with the `delete` operator.

> Using `delete` is different than assigning an undefined value! Deleting removes the key altogether.

<Example   
  title={"Adding and removing elements"}
  code={objectsAddingAndRemoving}
/>

---

## Checking existence

We use the `in` operator and the `hasOwnProperty` method to check if an object contains a key.

The difference: `in` also returns `true` for inherited properties.

<Example   
  title={"Checking existence"}
  code={inOperator}
/>

---

## Cloning and merging

We use `Object.assign` or spread syntax `...` to clone and merge objects.

If keys conflict, the last object merged takes precedence.

> Just like with arrays, merging is shallow; we only copy _references_ to elements.

<Example   
  title={"Cloning and merging"}
  code={objectsCloningAndMerging}
  sharedEnvironment={false}
/>

## Creating arrays from objects

We often want to run a function for each key, each value, or each key-value pair in an object. To do this, We generally convert the object into an array, and then transform it using array methods. 

We can use the static methods `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, and `Object.entries` to transform an object into an array.

> While we can use a `for ... in` loop, it's much less common. We mainly use `for ... in` for performance reasons or if we want to exit the loop early, but the difference is small.

<Example   
  title={"Creating arrays from objects"}
  code={objectTransformations}
/>

## Creating objects from arrays

After transforming an object to an array, we often want to transform the array _back_ to an object.

If we used `Object.entries`, we can then use `Object.fromEntries`. Alternately, we can achieve more custom behavior with `reduce`.

  title={"Creating objects from arrays"}
  code={objectsFromArrays}

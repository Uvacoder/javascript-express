The global `Math` object contains static methods for common math operations like rounding, min/max, and trigonometry.

## Rounding

We use `round` to get the nearest integer, `floor` to round down, and `ceil` to round up. 

<Example   
  title={"Rounding"}
  code={rounding}
/>

---

## Min and max

We use `min` and `max` find the smallest and largest number in a collection of numbers.

<Example   
  title={"Min and max"}
  code={minAndMax}
/>

---

## Trigonometry

We can access constants like `PI` and common trigonometry functions like `sin`.

<Example   
  title={"Trigonometry"}
  code={trigonometry}

A set is an unordered collections of values. Each value must be unique (it can appear at most once), and uniqueness is determined by (roughly) `===` comparison.

The main APIs are:

- `add`
- `has`
- `delete`

## Working with sets

When working with sets, we commonly convert them to and from arrays, since arrays have more built-in methods for transforming the contents.

> Converting an array to a set and back is a convenient way to remove duplicates

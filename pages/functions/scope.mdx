import scope from '../../examples/files/functions/scope.ts'

Functions declared with the `function` keyword are "hoisted" to the top of the block, and can be called anywhere within the block.

> Usually we try to declare functions before we use them, for clarity. However, this is common for mutually recursive function definitions, similar to [forward declarations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_declaration) in some C-like languages.

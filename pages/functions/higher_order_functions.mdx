# Higher Order Functions

A [higher order function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) is a function that takes a function as an argument or returns a function.

Let's look at some common examples.

## Callbacks

Callback functions are arguments passed to a function that are then called when some action or event occurs.

This is an extremely common pattern in JavaScript environments like the browser, `node`, and React Native.

> Some functions accept several callback functions for handling different actions.

<Example
  title={"Callbacks"}
  code={callbacks}
/>

## Functional programming

Programming in a "functional" style, by composing stateless, side-effect free functions, is very common in JavaScript.

We've already seen many standard library examples, like `map` and `reduce`. Here's an example of how we might write `map`.

> Higher order functions like `map` are often implemented using the stateful aspects of JavaScript, e.g. loops.

<Example
  title={"Functional programming"}
  code={higherOrder}

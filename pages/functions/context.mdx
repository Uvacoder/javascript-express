# Context

The keyword `this` refers to the "current execution context", or just the "context" for short.

We mostly use `this` in classes â€” its behavior is typically not helpful and somewhat error-prone elsewhere.

---

## Global `this`

Outside of any function, the current execution context is an environment-specific global variable (`window` in the browser, `global` in node).

<Example
  title={"Global this"}
  code={globalThis}
/>

---

## Function `this`

Inside a function declared with `function`, `this` refers to an arbitrary value set by the caller.

Inside a function declared with `=>`, `this` refers to whatever it was in the parent scope.

We can specify the `this` value with `.call()`.

<Example
  title={"Function this"}
  code={functionThis}
/>

---

## Automatic `this`

Functions that are properties of objects will have their `this` set to the object when called with `.` syntax. This applies to instances of classes too.

This is the main use case for `this`.

> Depending on your TypeScript compiler settings, you can force the type of `this` to be defined, which helps avoid errors.

<Example
  title={"Automatic this"}
  code={automaticThis}
/>
